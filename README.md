### Flask-Jenkins-Docker Demo Project

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for a Flask application using Jenkins and Docker. It showcases the process of building a Docker image from the Flask app, testing it (not included in this demo), and deploying it as a container.

**Key Features:**

* **Flask:** The core web framework for building the application.
* **Jenkins:** The automation server for orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline.
* **Docker:** The containerization platform for packaging and deploying the application.
* **Git:** Used for version control and storing the source code.

**Project Structure:**

```
flask-jenkins-docker-demo/
├── app.py           (Flask application code)
├── Dockerfile       (Instructions for building the Docker image)
├── Jenkinsfile      (Configuration of the Jenkins pipeline)
├── requirements.txt (Project dependencies)
└── .gitignore       (Files to be ignored by Git)
```

**How it Works:**

1. **Development:** The Flask application (`app.py`) is developed and tested locally.
2. **Version Control:** The code is committed to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
3. **Jenkins Trigger:** Jenkins monitors the Git repository for changes.
4. **Checkout:** When a change is detected, Jenkins checks out the latest code.
5. **Docker Build:** Jenkins uses the `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image of the application.
6. **Docker Run (Optional):** Jenkins can run the Docker container for testing purposes (not implemented in this basic demo).
7. **Deployment:** The Docker image is pushed to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub) and deployed to a production environment (not implemented in this basic demo).

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-jenkins-docker-demo.git`
2. **Install Docker and Jenkins:** Follow the instructions for your operating system.
3. **Configure Jenkins:** Set up a Jenkins pipeline job using the included `Jenkinsfile`.
4. **Run the Pipeline:** Trigger the Jenkins job to build and (optionally) deploy the Flask application.

**Note:** This is a simplified demonstration project. In a real-world scenario, you would typically add more comprehensive testing stages, automate deployments to various environments, and implement more robust error handling and logging.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Environment Variables:** Consider using environment variables to store sensitive configuration information.
* **Docker Compose:** For more complex applications with multiple services, Docker Compose can be used to define and manage the entire application stack.
* **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures for your Docker images and deployment environments.
